Slides for university guest lecture on JavaScript, available here:
[http://halvards.github.io/javascript-lecture-unsw/](http://halvards.github.io/javascript-lecture-unsw/).

Topics:
- What is JavaScript: A hybrid object-oriented/functional programming
language
- Created by Brendan Eich for Netscape Navigator 2.0 in 10 days in May
1995. Now CTO
of Mozilla Corporation. Originally called LiveScript, but renamed to
JavaScript because of Java's popularity (marketing decision). Brendan
was also ordered to make it 'look like Java'
- Inspired by C (syntax), Smalltalk (patterns), LISP (code is data), and Self (prototypal
inheritance)
- Actually much closer to LISP than to Java
- Standardisation taken over by ECMA in 1996
- Defined by ECMA-262, a.k.a. ECMAScript. Latest version is 5.1 (5th
edition)
- Runs in browsers and on the server
- The good: functions as first-class objects, dynamic typing, expressive object literal
notation, JSON, prototypal inheritance
- The bad: programming model based on global variables
- It's object-oriented, but it doesn't have classes
- It's functional, functions are a first-class type
-

- MDN is much better source than W3Schools
